# ExcessEnergy Tokens (EET)

## Overview

**ExcessEnergy Tokens (EET)** is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It tokenizes excess renewable energy production (e.g., from solar panels, wind turbines, or home batteries) into tradable ERC-20-like tokens. Producers can mint EET tokens for verified surplus energy, enabling peer-to-peer trading, carbon offset redemption, and incentives for sustainable energy adoption.

This project addresses real-world problems:
- **Energy Waste**: Globally, up to 20-30% of renewable energy is curtailed due to grid constraints. EET allows producers to "sell" excess without infrastructure upgrades.
- **Renewable Adoption Barriers**: High upfront costs and lack of incentives deter adoption. EET provides immediate liquidity via tokenization.
- **Decentralized Energy Markets**: Central grids are inefficient; EET enables P2P trading, reducing reliance on monopolies and lowering costs for consumers.
- **Carbon Tracking**: Integrates with oracles for verifiable offsets, aiding ESG compliance and net-zero goals.

The system uses off-chain oracles (e.g., IoT devices or Chainlink-like feeds on Stacks) to verify energy data, ensuring trustless minting. Tokens can be staked for governance, traded on DEXes, or redeemed for utility credits.

**Tech Stack**:
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin L2 for secure, low-fee transactions).
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity (7 core contracts for modularity and security).
- **Frontend**: React + Stacks.js (not included; see `/frontend` placeholder).
- **Oracles**: Custom integration with energy meters via Stacks' cross-chain events.
- **Token Standard**: SIP-10 (fungible tokens on Stacks).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Clarinet (Stacks CLI): `cargo install clarinet`
- Stacks Wallet (e.g., Leather or Hiro Wallet)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git 
`git clone <repo-url>`
   cd excess-energy-tokens
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run local devnet:
   ```
   clarinet integrate
   ```

### Development
- Contracts in `/contracts/`.
- Tests in `/tests/` (using Clarinet's suite).
- Deploy to testnet: `clarinet deploy --testnet`.

## Architecture

EET comprises 7 modular Clarity smart contracts for separation of concerns, auditability, and upgradability. Each handles a specific function, interacting via traits for composability.

### 1. ProducerRegistry
**Purpose**: Registers energy producers (e.g., households with solar) with KYC-lite verification and capacity limits. Solves trust issues by whitelisting verified meters.

**Key Functions**:
- `register-producer`: Adds a producer with wallet address and max capacity (kWh).
- `update-capacity`: Admins/oracles update based on audits.
- `is-registered?`: Checks eligibility for minting.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-data-var admin principal 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7)
(define-map producers { producer: principal } { capacity: uint, registered: bool })

(define-public (register-producer (max-capacity uint))
  (let ((caller tx-sender))
    (asserts! (not (get registered (map-get? producers { producer: caller }))) err-already-registered)
    (map-set producers { producer: caller } { capacity: max-capacity, registered: true })
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (is-registered? (producer principal))
  (default-to false (get registered (map-get? producers { producer: producer }))))
```

### 2. EnergyOracle
**Purpose**: Integrates off-chain data (e.g., from smart meters) via oracles to verify excess energy production. Solves data integrity with signed proofs.

**Key Functions**:
- `submit-proof`: Oracle submits hashed energy data (kWh excess).
- `verify-excess`: Validates against registry capacity.
- `get-latest-proof`: Retrieves recent verifications.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-map oracle-proofs { producer: principal, timestamp: uint } { excess-kwh: uint, signature: (buff 65) })

(define-public (submit-proof (producer principal) (excess-kwh uint) (timestamp uint) (signature (buff 65)))
  (asserts! (is-oracle? tx-sender) err-unauthorized)  ;; Check caller is trusted oracle
  (map-set oracle-proofs { producer: producer, timestamp: timestamp } 
           { excess-kwh: excess-kwh, signature: signature })
  (ok true))

(define-read-only (get-latest-proof (producer principal))
  ;; Simplified: fetch most recent timestamp
  (map-get? oracle-proofs { producer: producer, timestamp: block-height }))
```

### 3. TokenMinter
**Purpose**: Mints EET tokens (1 token = 1 kWh excess) based on oracle proofs. Solves liquidity by tokenizing real assets.

**Key Functions**:
- `mint-tokens`: Mints after verification; burns on redemption.
- `get-mintable`: Calculates based on proofs.
- Integrates SIP-10 for token standard.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.ft-trait.ft-trait)

(define-fungible-token eet-token u100000000)  ;; Max supply: 100M tokens

(define-public (mint-tokens (amount uint) (proof-id uint))
  (let ((caller tx-sender)
        (proof (contract-call? .energy-oracle get-proof proof-id)))
    (asserts! (is-registered? caller) err-not-registered)
    (asserts! (>= (get excess-kwh proof) amount) err-insufficient-proof)
    (ft-mint? eet-token amount caller)
    (ok amount)))
```

### 4. EnergyMarketplace
**Purpose**: Decentralized exchange for trading EET tokens (e.g., swap for STX or stablecoins). Solves market access with low-fee AMM.

**Key Functions**:
- `swap-eet-for-stx`: Liquidity pool swaps.
- `add-liquidity`: Providers add EET/STX pairs.
- `get-price`: Oracle-based pricing (kWh/USD).

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-map liquidity-pool { token-x: principal, token-y: principal } { reserve-x: uint, reserve-y: uint })

(define-public (swap-eet-for-stx (eet-amount uint))
  (let ((stx-out (contract-call? .math-lib get-amount-out eet-amount reserve-eet reserve-stx)))
    (ft-transfer? eet-token eet-amount tx-sender .marketplace)
    (as-contract (stx-transfer? stx-out tx-sender))
    (ok stx-out)))
```

### 5. RedemptionVault
**Purpose**: Redeems EET for real-world value (e.g., grid credits, fiat via partners). Solves usability by bridging on/off-chain.

**Key Functions**:
- `redeem-tokens`: Burns tokens for credits; emits event for off-chain fulfillment.
- `claim-credit`: Verifies and issues (e.g., NFT receipt).
- `get-redemption-rate`: Dynamic rate based on market.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-public (redeem-tokens (amount uint))
  (let ((caller tx-sender))
    (ft-burn? eet-token amount caller)
    ;; Emit event for off-chain processor
    (print { event: "redemption", amount: amount, user: caller })
    (ok { credits: (* amount u0.95) })))  ;; 5% fee for sustainability fund
```

### 6. StakingRewards
**Purpose**: Allows staking EET for yields (e.g., from trading fees). Solves long-term holding incentives.

**Key Functions**:
- `stake`: Lock tokens for rewards.
- `unstake`: Withdraw with accrued APY.
- `claim-rewards`: Distribute from pool.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-map stakes { owner: principal } { amount: uint, start-block: uint })

(define-public (stake (amount uint))
  (ft-transfer? eet-token amount tx-sender .staking-rewards)
  (map-set stakes { owner: tx-sender } 
           { amount: (+ (get amount (map-get? stakes { owner: tx-sender })) amount), 
             start-block: block-height })
  (ok true))

(define-read-only (calculate-rewards (owner principal))
  (let ((stake (unwrap! (map-get? stakes { owner: owner }) u0))
        (blocks-staked (- block-height (get start-block stake))))
    (* (get amount stake) (/ blocks-staked u3650))))  ;; ~10% APY simplified
```

### 7. GovernanceDAO
**Purpose**: DAO for parameter updates (e.g., mint rates, fees). Solves adaptability with token-weighted voting.

**Key Functions**:
- `propose`: Submit governance proposals.
- `vote`: Cast votes proportional to staked EET.
- `execute`: Auto-execute if quorum met.

**Sample Code Snippet**:
```clarity
(define-map proposals { id: uint } { description: (string-ascii 256), yes-votes: uint, no-votes: uint, executed: bool })

(define-public (vote (proposal-id uint) (support bool))
  (let ((staked (get-staked-balance tx-sender)))
    (asserts! (> staked u0) err-no-stake)
    (if support
      (map-set proposals { id: proposal-id } 
               { yes-votes: (+ (get yes-votes (map-get? proposals { id: proposal-id })) staked), 
                 .. })  ;; Simplified
      ;; Similar for no-votes
    )
    (ok true)))
```

## Deployment & Testing
